The inflation rate in Australia has slowed down in July, with the annual rate of headline inflation falling to 3.5 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent in June. However, economists believe that this slowdown is largely expected and will not lead to an immediate cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The RBA aims to reduce the underlying inflation rate, measured by the trimmed mean, to 2.5 per cent, but this is not forecasted to happen until late 2026 or early 2027. The RBA has kept interest rates steady at 4.35 per cent for the past six weeks, despite the volatility in financial and stock markets. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the most significant contributors to inflation in July were housing, food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco, and transport. However, the introduction of electricity rebates led to a significant fall in energy prices, with a 6.4 per cent decrease in July. Excluding the rebates, electricity prices would have risen by 0.9 per cent. The Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, stated that the ABS data showed that inflation would have been higher without the government's cost of living relief measures. Economists have warned that the monthly inflation data should be read with caution due to the temporary cost of living relief measures, which artificially push down inflation figures. The RBA will need further proof from future monthly inflation data and quarterly CPI prints to be convinced that price pressures are easing. The inflation data comes as Australia's supermarket giants, Coles and Woolworths, have posted their full-year profit results, with Woolworths reporting a huge decline in its after-tax profit and Coles reporting a higher profit. The results have sparked concerns about the lack of competition in the sector and the impact on consumers. The Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, has warned that people should not take too much signal from the ABS' monthly inflation indicator, as the quarterly inflation data is better quality and more comprehensive. The RBA has effectively talked itself into a corner, with the possibility of a rate hike if inflation comes in hotter than expected, or maintaining its reluctance to push rates even higher. The latest monthly inflation figures for July have also been affected by the focus on durable goods prices, such as clothing and household goods, rather than services and domestically driven factors. Nevertheless, some economists have pointed out positive signs in the July figures, including clear signs of disinflation in clothing and footwear, and household items. Overall, the inflation rate in Australia remains a concern, and the RBA will need to carefully consider its next move in terms of interest rates.
